# Country-Name-Standardization-Stata-and-Excel

Working with merging data based on country names can be a challenging task due to variations in country names, spelling, abbreviations, country codes, and even languages. These inconsistencies can cause significant difficulties when trying to merge datasets from different sources or when conducting cross-country analysis.

I provide several ways to simplify the process of merging data based on country names and codes. I provide detailed and comprehensive examples and country (and country code) lists to facilitate this project with your existing data using a VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH process.
